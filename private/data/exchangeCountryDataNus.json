      "visa": "All students are advised to apply for the necessary visa immediately after they receive the official offer letter/email from their host university. Some visa application processes can take up to 2 months to process. Your exchange at the host university depends on the clearance by the immigration of the host country.\n\nOnce you are admitted to the university, Undergraduate Admissions will send you a Certificate of Eligibility (Form DS-2019). This document, together with your notification of admission, the financial guarantee and your passport, is used to obtain a J-1 visa at a U.S. consulate nearest to you. To apply for a visa in your home country, you must apply early and expect delays. Consult individual embassy Web sites for periodic updates on country-specific visa processing. Lists of U.S. Embassies can be accessed through http://usembassy.state.gov.",
      "health": "All registered NUS students are covered under the University health insurance and the blanket travel insurance. For more information on the University health insurance coverage, please refer to http://www.nus.edu.sg/uhc/healthservice/insuranceschemes/undergraduate-scheme.html. For more information on the blanket travel insurance, please refer to http://www.nus.edu.sg/finance/InsuranceCoverforOfficialNUSTrips.html If the insurance coverage is not enough, students are advised to purchase additional health and/or travel insurance from their preferred agent. All international exchange students are automatically enrolled in the ASU Student Health Insurance plan. Read more about what is covered under this insurance at the Arizona State University student health insurance plan website.\n\nWaiver requests for incoming international students will no longer be accepted as of Spring 2016. All international students coming in as new and returning students will be issued the mandatory ASU Aetna Student Health Plan Insurance.\n\nhttps://studyabroad.asu.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Pare nt_ID=61542CC2-5056-A035-EF77EA76343FEC07&Link_ID=6FAC384C-97A5- EA89-7B7E90E36227EC1F"
