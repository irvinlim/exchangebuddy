      "visa": "All students are advised to apply for the necessary visa immediately after they receive the official offer letter/email from their host university. Some visa application processes can take up to 2 months to process. Your exchange at the host university depends on the clearance by the immigration of the host country.\n\nOnce you are admitted to the university, Undergraduate Admissions will send you a Certificate of Eligibility (Form DS-2019). This document, together with your notification of admission, the financial guarantee and your passport, is used to obtain a J-1 visa at a U.S. consulate nearest to you. To apply for a visa in your home country, you must apply early and expect delays. Consult individual embassy Web sites for periodic updates on country-specific visa processing. Lists of U.S. Embassies can be accessed through http://usembassy.state.gov."
